TO RUN THE GAME
****************


First select the appropriate settings, difficulty, and time per day. Easy is
the only difficulty level under which the pause feature is enabled. Next, 
select ‘Choose Default Sites’, pick a scenario and click ’Start Sim’. Once the
scenario has been loaded, the ‘Settings’ tab will no longer be active or able 
to be accessed. After a scenario has been preloaded, only the ’Sites’ tab will
be active. On the ’Sites’ tab, to get a sites info, click on the circle of the
site and a pane with its infer will pop up.

Some snippets of code in this project were originally written by Zach Davis,
Brown class of 2013. Other parts were originally written by Luke Fraker, but
inspired by Zach Davis's support code, written for the Brown class, CS195n 2D
GameEngines. Permission to use Zach's code in full has been requested and
granted by Zach, so long as he is credited and it is not used for revenue in
any way.


All code in the subdirectories of the src/game/org folder was originally
written by Jan Peter Stotz, and is known as JMapViewer. Some of it has been
edited since. Also, the class, game.components.GameMapController.java was based
on code written by Jan Peter Stotz, as JMapViewer, and edited since then. Since
it was written, some of the code has been further edited for offline use by
Paulus Schoutsen. However, the modified JMapViewer used here only works with an
internet connection, and thus deals mainly with the original code.
